# Flow
  1. Head coach creates a route/race
  2. Head coach adds checkpoints (w/ unique names for race)
  3. Head coach emails volunteers/coaches to sign up for race (includes race link)
  4. Head coach emails competitors with link to signup/login
  5. Volunteers sign up
  6. Competitors signup and log bib names
  7. Race starts
      - volunteer/coach locations auto log
      - volunteer/coach dropdown for tracks they are in charge of (bicyclists etc.)
  8. Intervals are logged

# Ideas

  * Checkpoints/Waterstops uniquely named for race
  * tracks coaches within 10ft
  * Coach dropdown for what track they are logging
  * Intervals?
## Frontend

# Potential technologies
